### Logo
The logo of the Sankofa Coding Circle is the *Sankofa Tag*.  It is comprised of two elements: 1) html angle brackets and 2) the Sankofa Adinkra symbol.  Html brackets tell internet browsers how present elements of the web page.  Adinkra symbols are codifications of ancestral wisdom in the form of proverbs by the Asante of West Africa. The Sankofa bird instructs lets us knonw that it is not taboo to remember who we are and our history.  By using this tag, we are opening the collective wisdom of our history while moving deeper into the technology that defines digital communication.
